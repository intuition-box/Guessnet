● Found the issue! The Factory-Oracle connection is correct, but the
  existing markets are still connected to the old deployer address
  (0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266) instead of the real
  Oracle contract (0x9A9f2CCfdE556A7E9Ff0848998Aa4a0CFD8863AE).

     ☐ Fix Oracle showing 'No data/Invalid' status

● The existing markets are using the wrong Oracle address. I need to
  redeploy the entire system cleanly.

● Bash(yarn deploy --reset)
